[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/html-webpack-include-assets-plugin.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/html-webpack-include-assets-plugin) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jharris4/html-webpack-include-assets-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jharris4/html-webpack-include-assets-plugin) [![js-semistandard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-semistandard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard)

Enhances [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin)
functionality by allowing you to specify js or css assets to be included.

When using a plugin such as [copy-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin) you may have assets output to your build directory that are not detected/output by the html-webpack-plugin.

This plugin allows you to force some of these assets to be included in the output from html-webpack-plugin.

Installation
------------
You must be running webpack on node 0.12.x or higher

Install the plugin with npm:
```shell
$ npm install --save-dev html-webpack-include-assets-plugin
```


Basic Usage
-----------
Require the plugin in your webpack config:

```javascript
var HtmlWebpackIncludeAssetsPlugin = require('html-webpack-include-assets-plugin');
```

Add the plugin to your webpack config as follows:

```javascript
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new HtmlWebpackIncludeAssetsPlugin({ assets: [], append: true })
]  
```

When you set `option.assets` to an array of strings, the matched assets will be output into your html-webpack-plugin template.

The `option.append` must be a boolean, specifying whether the assets should be prepended before any existing assets, or appended after them.

Only assets ending in `.js` or `.css` are supported. The presence of assets that do not end in these extensions will cause an error.

The `option.publicPath` may be a boolean or string, specifying whether the assets should be prepended with webpack's public path or a custom publicPath.

The publicPath defaults to `true`. A value of `false` may be used to disable prefixing with webpack's publicPath, or a value like `myPublicPath/`
may be used to prefix all assets with the given string.

```javascript
plugins: [
  new CopyWebpackPlugin([
    { from: 'node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css', to: 'css/'},
    { from: 'node_modules/bootstrap/dist/fonts', to: 'fonts/'}
  ]),
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new HtmlWebpackIncludeAssetsPlugin({
    assets: ['css/bootstrap.min.css', 'css/bootstrap-theme.min.css'],
    append: false
  })
]  
```

```javascript
plugins: [
  new CopyWebpackPlugin([
    { from: 'node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css', to: 'css/'},
    { from: 'node_modules/bootstrap/dist/fonts', to: 'fonts/'}
  ]),
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new HtmlWebpackIncludeAssetsPlugin({
    assets: ['css/bootstrap.min.css', 'css/bootstrap-theme.min.css'],
    append: false,
    publicPath: 'myPublicPath/'
  })
]
```
